                        <p>The first thing we do is meeting with our clients and talk through their goals on a future project. During this meeting, feel free to communicate your ideas and ask lots of questions.</p>
                        <p>This stage is highly decisive as you can evaluate the work of your potential architect by browsing their portfolio. As a client, you may also assess whether the architect listens to your needs and confirms that he or she understands them.</p>
